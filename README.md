# Introduction
GWECS, or GWE's C# Test Program, is a program series designed to test C# and its capabilities. This is part 2.  
~~Part 1 will be available soon.~~ I no longer code in C#, so there will be no part 1.

This was inspired by [Girrafe Academy's C# Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpNIBTYHNDrhfE9C-imUXCmk).

# Programs
The programs available are:

GUESS THE SECRET WORD - Find the secret word hidden in the code. Can you do it?  
DIVISOR & MULTIPLE CALCULATOR - Having trouble with divisor and multiple math problems? Then this is for you!
